# dZENcodeWebSocketClient

This is a client for my test application on Node.js, that connects by websocket to it, and waits for messages

If someone making POST request and creating a message, it will gonna appear in the console, if you are connected

To use this client, first, run command:

npm install

Then, you can start the web socket client:

npm run dev

If the main Node.js app is working, you are gonna connect
